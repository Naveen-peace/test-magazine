            Spider-Man: No Way Home is a 2021 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character Spider-Man,
            co-produced by Columbia Pictures and Marvel Studios and distributed by Sony Pictures Releasing. It is the
            sequel
            to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and the 27th film in the Marvel
            Cinematic
            Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Jon Watts and written by Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers. It stars
            Tom
            Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man alongside Zendaya, Benedict Cumberbatch, Jacob Batalon, Jon Favreau,
            Jamie
            Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Benedict Wong, Tony Revolori, Marisa Tomei, Andrew Garfield, and Tobey
            Maguire. In the film, Parker asks Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) to use magic to make his identity as
            Spider-Man a secret again following its public revelation at the end of Far From Home. When the spell goes
            wrong
            because of Parker's actions, the multiverse is broken open, which allows visitors from alternate realities
            to
            enter Parker's universe.

            Tom Holland as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:
            A teenager and Avenger who received spider-like abilities after being bitten by a radioactive spider.[5] The
            film explores the fallout of Spider-Man: Far From Home's (2019) mid-credits scene, in which Parker's
            identity as
            Spider-Man is exposed,[6] and Parker is more pessimistic in contrast to previous Marvel Cinematic Universe
            (MCU)
            films. Holland said Parker feels defeated and insecure and was excited to explore the darker side of the
            character.[7] The adjustment back to portraying Parker, including raising his voice pitch and returning to
            the
            mindset of a "na√Øve, charming teenager", was strange for Holland after taking on more mature roles such as
            in
            Cherry (2021).[8]

            Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker / Spider-Man:
            An alternate version of Parker who is haunted by his failure to save his deceased girlfriend, Gwen
            Stacy.[32][31] Garfield reprises his role from Webb's The Amazing Spider-Man films.[33][34] The other
            Spider-Men
            refer to him as "Peter-Three",[35] while Marvel's official website named him "The Amazing Spider-Man".[36]
            Garfield embraced his role as the middle brother of the group and was interested in exploring the idea of a
            tortured Parker following the events of The Amazing Spider-Man 2, including how lessons from those events
            could
            be passed to Holland's character.[31] He was grateful for the chance to "tie up some loose ends" for his
            incarnation of Parker, and described working with Holland and Maguire as an opportunity to have "deeper
            conversations... about our experiences with the character".[37] Parker ends up saving MJ during the climax
            in a
            similar way to how he fails to save Stacy in The Amazing Spider-Man 2; McKenna and co-writer Erik Sommers
            credited director Jon Watts for coming up with the idea while they watched a pre-visualization reel
            showcasing
            ideas for the climactic battle.[16]

            In April 2021, Molina confirmed that he was appearing in the film, explaining that he had been told not to
            talk
            about his role in the film during production but he realized that his appearance had been widely rumored and
            reported on.[26] Later that month, J. B. Smoove revealed that he was returning as Julius Dell from Far From
            Home,[46] while Cox stated that he was not involved with the film.[115] In early May, Garfield denied that
            he
            had been asked to appear in the film, but later said "never say never",[116][117] while Angourie Rice was
            revealed to be returning as Betty Brant.[43] Later that month, Stone denied her involvement in the
            film.[118]
